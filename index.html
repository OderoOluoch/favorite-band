        <div class="about-band"> 
        <p>
            <em> Around 1980, when Zimbabwe was moving towards it independence,</em>
                 Oliver Mtukudzi set to sing revolutionary jam songs 
                 with undertones targeting the repressive Rhodesian 
                 regime. Some of the songs played by the band,included 
                 songs of the day-to-day social life of the people 
                 and the essence of Ubantu (humanity). Quoting words
                  from the man himself, he says , “Before independence,
                   it was the fight against the Rhodesian regime. My 
                   music then spoke against oppression and the repressive 
                   regime and how we were suffering at the hands of the regime.
                    I left school and for three years I couldn’t find a job, yet
                     I was one of the few guys among my peers with a fine secondary
                      education. But I couldn’t get a job because I was black. My 
                      music then helped people identify themselves…who we were and 
                      what we wanted to be.”
            <br>
                    In all his music in pre-independence, 
                    <strong>Oliver never took on the Rhodesian regime
                    head-on</strong>, preferring the power of metaphor 
                    to communicate meaning. “I wasn’t afraid of anyone.
                    The beauty of the Shona language [the majority vernacular
                    language in Zimbabwe] is that it is endowed with all those 
                    rich idioms and metaphor… and the beauty of art is that
                        you can use the power of language to craft particular 
                        meaning without necessarily giving it away. So, I used the
                        beauty of Shona to communicate in my own way and people got 
                        the message. To this day, Oliver incorporates the aspect of 
                        self-discipline and tolerance in his repertoires.
                        He is emotional about the socio-cultural norms 
                        and principles that govern the Shona traditional 
                        way of life, particularly the respect for the next person.

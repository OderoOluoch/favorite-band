               <em> In the period leading to Zimbabwe’s 1980 independence, </em>
                Oliver’s music was a mix of the revolutionary 
                jam songs with undertones targeting the repressive 
                Rhodesian regime. Yet he also composed the day-to-day
                social context music about life and the essence of ubantu (humanity).
                “Before independence, it was the fight against the Rhodesian regime. 
                My music then spoke against oppression and the repressive regime and 
                how we were suffering at the hands of the regime. 
                I left school and for three years I couldn’t find a job,
                yet I was one of the few guys among my peers with a fine 
                secondary education. But I couldn’t get a job because I was 
                black. My music then helped people identify
                    themselves…who we were and what we wanted to be.”
            <br>
                    In all his music in pre-independence, 
                    <strong>Oliver never took on the Rhodesian regime
                    head-on</strong>, preferring the power of metaphor 
                    to communicate meaning. “I wasn’t afraid of anyone.
                    The beauty of the Shona language [the majority vernacular
                    language in Zimbabwe] is that it is endowed with all those 
                    rich idioms and metaphor… and the beauty of art is that
                        you can use the power of language to craft particular 
                        meaning without necessarily giving it away. So, I used the
                        beauty of Shona to communicate in my own way and people got 
                        the message. To this day, Oliver incorporates the aspect of 
                        self-discipline and tolerance in his repertoires.
                        He is emotional about the socio-cultural norms 
                        and principles that govern the Shona traditional 
                        way of life, particularly the respect for the next person.
